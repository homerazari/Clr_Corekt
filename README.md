# Clr_Corekt


The program is in its alpha stage. It is currently designed to take an image as an input and adaptively color correct it.
Further development will utilize the functions set upt to handle videos. It utilizes ffmpeg's RGB curve filter to do the
correction after values are given to it by the program. This program is not packaged it is dependent on python/ffmpeg
to be installed to work properly.
